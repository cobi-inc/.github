COBI is revolutionizing optimization problems by using **C**oupled **O**scillator **B**ased **I**ntelligent computers to solve problems intractable and unsolvable by even the best classical CPUs and GPUs. COBI chips are built using todayâ€™s CMOS technology, and are capable of solving hard optimization problems on the cloud or in an edge device.
